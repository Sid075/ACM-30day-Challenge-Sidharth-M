ACM 30-Day Machine Learning Challenge â€“ Sidharth M

Cycle 1: Daily Progress

Day 1:
- Performed basic data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a burnout dataset.
- Handled missing values, explored distributions, and generated summary statistics.

Day 2:
- Applied feature encoding and preprocessing techniques.
- Created new interaction features, selected important variables, and prepared the data for modeling.

Day 3:
- Built Logistic Regression and LDA models to classify burnout risk.
- Evaluated models using accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC-AUC.
- Compared model results and visualized performance with ROC curves.

Notebooks:
- Day1.ipynb: Data cleaning and exploration

- Day3.ipynb: Classification models and evaluation

Tools & Libraries Used:
- Python (Kaggle Notebook)
- pandas for data handling
- numpy for numerical computations
- scikit-learn for preprocessing, feature selection, and machine learning models
