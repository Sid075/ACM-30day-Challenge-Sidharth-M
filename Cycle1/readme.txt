ACM 30-Day Machine Learning Challenge â€“ Sidharth M

Cycle 1: Daily Progress

Day 1:
- Performed basic data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a burnout dataset.
- Handled missing values, explored distributions, and generated summary statistics.

Day 2:
- Applied feature encoding and preprocessing techniques.
- Created new interaction features, selected important variables, and prepared the data for modeling.

Notebooks:
- Day1.ipynb: Data cleaning and exploration
- Day2.ipynb: Feature encoding and preprocessing

Tools & Libraries Used:
- Python (Kaggle Notebook)
- pandas for data handling
- numpy for numerical computations
- scikit-learn for preprocessing, feature selection, and machine learning models
- matplotlib and seaborn for visualization (as needed)
