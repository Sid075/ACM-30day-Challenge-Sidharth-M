| Day 1 | Performed EDA and preprocessing on the Insurance dataset. Handled missing values, encoded categorical features, and visualized key trends.                                                                                    |
| Day 2 | Built regression models (Linear, Decision Tree, Random Forest) on the Insurance dataset. Compared R² scores and trained pipelines.                                                                                            |
| Day 3 | Evaluated model performance using cross-validation. Performed hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV for improved accuracy.                                                                                                  |
| Day 4 | Explored class imbalance and oversampling techniques. Implemented SMOTE and RandomOverSampler to rebalance the dataset.                                                                                                       |
| Day 5 | Visualized feature importance and decision boundaries. Built interactive confusion matrices and classification reports.                                                                                                       |

| Day 6 | Compared RandomForest, AdaBoost, and XGBoost classifiers on the Breast Cancer dataset using accuracy and basic error analysis in a Jupyter Notebook.                                                                          |
| Day 7 | Trained Linear, RBF, and Polynomial SVMs on the Credit Card dataset. Visualized 2D PCA components and compared model accuracy.                                                                                                |
| Day 8 | Clustered the Iris dataset using k-Means and Hierarchical methods. Visualized results with PCA. Explained real-world use cases.                                                                                               |
| Day 9 | Transformed text data using TF-IDF and reduced its dimensionality with SVD. Visualized the first two components and optionally clustered into 20 groups using KMeans. Silhouette score was used to assess clustering quality.|
| Day 10| Applied KFold cross-validation and plotted learning curves for SVM on the Iris dataset. Analyzed bias-variance tradeoff and discussed underfitting vs overfitting cases.                                                   |
