# ACM 30-Day Machine Learning Challenge – SIDHARTH M

## Daily Progress

### Cycle 1

| Day   | Summary |
|-------|---------|
| Day 1 | Performed EDA and preprocessing on the Insurance dataset. Handled missing values, encoded categorical features, and visualized key trends. |
| Day 2 | Built regression models (Linear, Decision Tree, Random Forest) on the Insurance dataset. Compared R² scores and trained pipelines. |
| Day 3 | Evaluated model performance using cross-validation. Performed hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV for improved accuracy. |
| Day 4 | Explored class imbalance and oversampling techniques. Implemented SMOTE and RandomOverSampler to rebalance the dataset. |
| Day 5 | Visualized feature importance and decision boundaries. Built interactive confusion matrices and classification reports. |

### Cycle 2

| Day   | Summary |
|-------|---------|
| Day 6 | Compared RandomForest, AdaBoost, and XGBoost classifiers on the Breast Cancer dataset using accuracy and basic error analysis. |
| Day 7 | Trained Linear, RBF, and Polynomial SVMs on the Credit Card dataset. Visualized 2D PCA components and compared model accuracy. |
| Day 8 | Clustered the Iris dataset using k-Means and Hierarchical methods. Visualized results with PCA. Explained real-world use cases. |
| Day 9 | Transformed text data using TF-IDF and reduced its dimensionality with SVD. Visualized PCA results and evaluated clustering with silhouette score. |
| Day 10 | Applied KFold cross-validation and plotted learning curves for SVM on the Iris dataset. Analyzed bias-variance tradeoff. |
| Main Challenge | Built a tweet sentiment classifier using the Sentiment140 dataset. Cleaned raw tweets, applied TF-IDF vectorization, and trained an SVM classifier. Evaluated model using accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix table. |
